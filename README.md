# Hilbert-curve
 
Python 3 code that turns an image into a one dimensional array that preserves locality, using a construction given by the Hilbert Curve, without loss of information. Excel and VB were later used to analyse the results and ensure the construction conserved locality. 

These results might be applied to lossless image compression.
